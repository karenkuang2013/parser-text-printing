This document is a guide to explain how I handle the parser. In this parser project, we mainly
take advantage of the characteristics of recursion.

In project 3, I need to use the implementation of project2. That is to say, I may need to add more
tokens like semicolon, power, for into project 2.
Before I modify the parser.java file, I need to add more trees into the AST package.
